# Title
Social Attributes in Collaboration between Spotify Artists and Comparison with Scientific Collaboration.

# Description
Course project for POLS7334 18589 Social Networks SEC 01 Fall 2020 [BOS-2-TR] at Northeastern University, Boston. 

# Abstract
Collaboration networks have been widely studied in different social scenarios and these networks provide a broad insight into how people cooperate to achieve certain goals. Historically, inter-disciplinary collaboration has been infrequent in science. Researchers from the same domain of science and humanities tend to work together to contribute towards that domain. The scenario is different in music production. Collaboration between artists from different genres is common and inter-genre collaborations produce numerous popular songs. Social attributes like gender and race have significant influence on musical collaborations. Furthermore, collaboration patterns change over time. Artists mostly collaborate during their early and mid-careers.
